# Pep Talk Generator
This is a simple pep talk generator that generates a random pep talk from four sets of pep talk partials. The pep talk partials are stored in a json file, an array of arrays, and the program picks a random partial from each list and concatenates them to create a pep talk that gets displayed on screen.
